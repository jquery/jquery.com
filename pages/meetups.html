<p>We used to feature a site for organizing jQuery meetups. Since that didn't really go anywhere, we've shut it down and replaced it with this page.</p>
<p>If you're looking for meetups, check out <a href="http://jquery.meetup.com/">jquery.meetup.com</a></p>

<h2>Meetup-in-a-bag</h2>
<p>If you're organizing a jQuery or JavaScript meetup and want to help the jQuery Foundation with recruiting individual members, we can help you with a meetup-in-a-bag. This consists of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A large commuter bag</li>
	<li>Five t-shirts in various sizes</li>
	<li>Lots of stickers</li>
	<li>Coupons</li>
	<li>iPhone skins</li>
</ul>
<p>We just need your address and something to show that you're serious about organizing a meetup. <a href="mailto:info@jquery.org">You can contact us by email</a>.</p>
