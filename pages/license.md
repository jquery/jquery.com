## Source Code

## Sample Code

All demos and examples, whether in a Project's repository or displayed on a Project site, are released under the terms of the license as specified in the relevant repository. Many Projects choose to release their sample code under the terms of [CC0](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/creative-commons-cc0-1-0-universal).
