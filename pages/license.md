## Source Code

Projects referencing this document are released under the terms of the [MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).

The MIT License is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the Project.

You are free to use the Project in any other project (even commercial projects) as long as the copyright header is left intact.

## Sample Code

All demos and examples, whether in a Project's repository or displayed on a Project site, are released under the terms of the license as specified in the relevant repository. Many Projects choose to release their sample code under the terms of [CC0](https://tldrlegal.com/l/cc0-1.0).

CC0 is even more permissive than the MIT license, allowing you to use the code in any manner you want, without any copyright headers, notices, or other attribution.
