<p>Any problem with jQuery in the above browsers should be reported as a bug in jQuery.</p>
<p><em>(Current - 1) and Current</em> denotes that we support the current stable version of the browser and the version that preceded it. For example, if the current version of a browser is 24.x, we support the 24.x and 23.x versions.</p>
<p><em>Current</em> denotes that we support only the latest stable build of the browser.</p>
<p>If you need to support older browsers like Internet Explorer 6-7, Opera 12.17 or Safari 5.1, use <a href="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js" download>jQuery 1.11.3</a>.</p>

<h2>Unsupported Browsers</h2>
<p>While jQuery <em>might</em> run without major issues in older browser versions, we do not actively test jQuery in them and generally do not fix bugs that may appear in them.</p>

<p>Similarly, jQuery does not fix bugs in pre-release versions of browsers, such as beta or dev releases. If you find a bug with jQuery in a pre-release of a browser, you should report the bug to the browser vendor.</p>

<h2>About Browser Support</h2>
<p>jQuery is constantly tested with all of its supported browsers via unit tests. However, a web page using jQuery may not work in the same set of browsers if its own code takes advantage of (or falls prey to) browser-specific behaviors. Testing is essential to fully support a browser. The <a href="http://modern.ie/">modern.IE</a> site makes available <a href="http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads">virtual machines</a> for testing many different versions of Internet Explorer. Older versions of other browsers can be found at <a href="http://oldversion.com/">oldversion.com</a>.</p>

<p>Only the most current version of jQuery is tested and updated to fix bugs or add features. Users of older versions that find a bug should upgrade to the latest released version to determine if the bug has already been fixed. The <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/#readme">jQuery Migrate plugin</a> may be helpful in identifying and fixing problems during a version upgrade.</p>

<hr>

<h2>About CSS Selector Compatibility</h2>
<p>Regardless of a browser's support of CSS selectors, all selectors listed at <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/">api.jquery.com/category/selectors/</a> will return the correct set of elements when passed as an argument of the <code>jQuery</code> function.</p>
<p>CSS styles applied with jQuery's <code>.css()</code> method are dependent on the browser's level of support. In general, jQuery does not attempt to overcome the limitations of a browser's style rendering. (One exception is <code>opacity</code>, which jQuery "shims" for older Internet Explorer's alternative implementation.) Furthermore, prior to version 1.8, jQuery does not normalize vendor-prefixed properties.</p>
