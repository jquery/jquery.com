<p>Any problem with jQuery in the above browsers should be considered and reported as a bug in jQuery.</p>
<p><em>(current - 1) or newer</em> denotes that we support the current stable version of the browser and the version that preceded it. For example, if the current version of a browser is 24.x, we support the 24.x and 23.x versions.</p>
<p><em>12.1x, (current - 1) or newer</em> denotes that we support Opera 12.1x as well as last 2 versions of Opera. For example, if the current Opera version is 20.x, we support Opera 12.1x, 19.x and 20.x but not Opera 15.x through 18.x.</p>

<h2>Unsupported Browsers</h2>
<p>While jQuery <em>might</em> run without major issues in older browser versions, we do not actively test jQuery in them and generally do not fix bugs that may appear in them. </p>

<h2>About CSS &amp; Browser Compatibility</h2>
<p>Regardless of a browser's support of CSS selectors, all selectors listed at <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/">api.jquery.com/category/selectors/</a> will return the correct set of elements when passed as an argument of the <code>jQuery</code> function.</p>
<p>CSS styles applied with jQuery's <code>.css()</code> method are dependent on the browser's level of support. In general, jQuery does not attempt to overcome the limitations of a browser's style rendering (one exception is opacity, which jQuery "shims" for older Internet Explorer's alternative implementation). Furthermore, prior to version 1.8, jQuery does not normalize vendor-prefixed properties.</p>
