<h2>Current Active Support</h2>

<h3>Desktop</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Chrome: (Current - 1) and Current</li>
	<li>Edge: (Current - 1) and Current</li>
	<li>Firefox: (Current - 1) and Current, ESR</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer: 9+</li>
	<li>Safari: (Current - 1) and Current</li>
	<li>Opera: Current</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mobile</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Stock browser on Android 4.0+<sup>[1]</sup></li>
	<li>Safari on iOS 7+<sup>[1]</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>[1] Workarounds for Android Browser 4.0-4.3 & iOS 7 are present in the code base, but we no longer actively test these versions. iOS 8 & newer versions are tested.</p>

<p>Any problem with jQuery in the above browsers should be reported as a bug in jQuery.</p>

<p><em>(Current - 1) and Current</em> denotes that we support the current stable version of the browser and the version that preceded it. For example, if the current version of a browser is 24.x, we support the 24.x and 23.x versions.</p>

<p>Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) is a Firefox version for use by organizations including schools, universities, businesses and others who need extended support for mass deployments. It is based on a regular release of Firefox and synced from the next regular Firefox every few releases - example ESR versions include Firefox 47, 52 &amp; 60. At any given time there are at most two ESR versions available; jQuery supports both of them. See <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/">the Mozilla site</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If you need to support older browsers like Internet Explorer 6-8, Opera 12.1x or Safari 5.1+, use <a href="https://releases.jquery.com/jquery/#jquery-all-1.x">jQuery 1.12</a>.</p>

<h2>Unsupported Browsers</h2>
<p>While jQuery <em>might</em> run without major issues in older browser versions, we do not actively test jQuery in them and generally do not fix bugs that may appear in them.</p>

<p>Similarly, jQuery does not fix bugs in pre-release versions of browsers, such as beta or dev releases. If you find a bug with jQuery in a pre-release of a browser, you should report the bug to the browser vendor.</p>

<h2>About Browser Support</h2>
<p>jQuery is constantly tested with all of its supported browsers via unit tests. However, a web page using jQuery may not work in the same set of browsers if its own code takes advantage of (or falls prey to) browser-specific behaviors. Testing is essential to fully support a browser.

<p>Only the most current version of jQuery is tested and updated to fix bugs or add features. Users of older versions that find a bug should upgrade to the latest released version to determine if the bug has already been fixed. The <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/#readme">jQuery Migrate plugin</a> may be helpful in identifying and fixing problems during a version upgrade.</p>

<hr>

<h2>About CSS Selector Compatibility</h2>
<p>Regardless of a browser's support of CSS selectors, all selectors listed at <a href="https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/">api.jquery.com/category/selectors/</a> will return the correct set of elements when passed as an argument of the <code>jQuery</code> function.</p>
<p>CSS styles applied with jQuery's <code>.css()</code> method are dependent on the browser's level of support. In general, jQuery does not attempt to overcome the limitations of a browser's style rendering. (One exception is <code>opacity</code>, which jQuery "shims" for older Internet Explorer's alternative implementation.) Furthermore, prior to version 1.8, jQuery does not normalize vendor-prefixed properties.</p>
