## Version Support Status

We support only the latest version of jQuery. The 1.x and 2.x branches are no longer supported.

jQuery 3.x is the current version branch of jQuery.

jQuery 4.0 is in beta. Once jQuery 4.0 is released, we will provide security patches and bug fixes on the 3.x branch for a limited time.

#### Still on an old version? Here are your options

* Upgrade to the latest version of jQuery. If possible, the best solution is to upgrade as it will include all features, bug fixes, security patches, and improvements. The [jQuery Migrate Plugin](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate) and [upgrade guides](/upgrade-guide) are ready to help with upgrading.
* If migrating is not an option but you'd like to include all security patches, you can obtain [commercial security support](#commercial-support) for your applications to keep them secure.
* If your application has no security requirements, then you can stay on one of the unsupported versions of jQuery, but be aware that this can come with multiple risks.
